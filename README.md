# Test-Driven-Development
This project built via Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV. The game car drive automatically and scan road lines and traffic signs.

Project is completed but this repository does not include necessary packages(because github cant acces larger than 100MB files). For test this project
you must upload necesssary packages(etc tensorflow.). After run the project, terminal says what necessary are.
